README FILE FOR FALL 2012/CSC573/PROJECT 1

Setup:
1. The Operating System needs to be UNIX based. (Since, some OS commands which are run from the code are bash commands)
2. Put the peer1.py and RFC1 folder together in the same folder from where the peer1.py file will be run by command line. 
Run the file as --> $python peer1.py
3. Do the same for peer2.py and RFC2 folder.
